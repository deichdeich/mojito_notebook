How to set up rclone for DDPC GlobalStorage Nextcloud
-----------------------------------------------------

In a browser:
    1. Log into https://nextcloud-dcc-fi-csc-okd-globalstorage1.2.rahtiapp.fi/
        * Use LISA Mission Directory credentials

    2. Go to User > Settings > Security

    3. Under "Devices & sessions", there is a field called "App name". Create a new app called "rclone".

    4. Click "Create new app password"

    5. Save the automatically generated password somewhere temporary

Locally:
    1. If you have not yet set up `rclone`, create a new config file by running
        ```
        > rclone config
        ```

    2. Find it with
        ```
        > rclone config file
        ```

    3. Open that file in an editor, and add a section like so:
       ```
        [globalstorage1]
        type = webdav
        url
= https://nextcloud-dcc-fi-csc-okd-globalstorage1.2.rahtiapp.fi/remote.php/dav/files/<LMD_ACCOUNT_NAME>/
        vendor = nextcloud
        bearer_token = <PASSWORD_CREATED_IN_BROWSER>
        nextcloud_chunk_size = 0M
       ```

    Note the two fields to be filled in, in the `url` and `bearer_token` lines

    4. Now, to download, follow the `rclone` documentation. Here are the
       recommended settings for the brickmarket:

         ```
	> rclone copy --checksum --timeout 120m -vv globalstorage1:/brickmarket/path/to/data path/to/local/directory
	```
